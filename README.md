# Project5
forgot to add 4x4 cama0004

I began the project by reading the "Mesonet.txt" file and creating a frame for my window.
Once I had my frame I began to create panels.
In my first panel I placed a JLabel, JTextField, JSlider, and a JButton
Although I was able to get my slider to work I didn't get my JButton to work.
For panel2 I included another JButton, JTextArea, JComboBox, and JLabels and JTextFields for those corresponding to the distance labels.
For panel3 I included the JButton "Add Station" and a JTextField that limits the user to only 4 characters. 

I was unable to get the Show Station button and Add Station to funtion properly.
